# Lora Mesh

Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a Lora Mesh using ESP32 boards in conjunction with a GPS to track locations and other various data of racers and eport back to a main host, ie a server. The devices will all be able to custom addressable with a name or number of each individual racer. The server will be able to see data such as location, speed, heading direction, and possibly something along the lines of acceleration or orientation using a 12DOF accelerometer.

What is LoRa®?

LoRa (short for long range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. Semtech’s LoRa is a long range, low power wireless platform that has become the de facto wireless platform of Internet of Things (IoT). LoRa devices and networks such as the LoRaWAN® enable smart IoT applications that solve some of the biggest challenges facing our planet: energy management, natural resource reduction, pollution control, infrastructure efficiency, and disaster prevention. Semtech’s LoRa devices have amassed several hundred known uses cases for smart cities, homes and buildings, communities, metering, supply chain and logistics, agriculture, and more. With hundreds of millions of devices connected to networks in more than 100 countries and growing, LoRa is creating a smarter planet.
